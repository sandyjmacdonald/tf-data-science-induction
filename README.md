These are a set of induction materials for new members of the Technology Facility Data Science Hub.

They capture what we think are the most important pieces of knowledge for new starters in the group, or for staff or students working with the group temporarily. They should also provide a useful referenc point for current memebers of the group.

Work through these at your own pace, make sure that you understand them, and ask us if you need any more help or guidance.
